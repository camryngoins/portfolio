# My Portfolio

## Description

- I started by going ahead and creating the layout for the HTML by including the header and the nagivation and footer, and then creating the 3 sections: About Me, My Work and Contact Me. 
- I then added a headshot of me to the About Me section, and then made sure that the navigations links scrolled to the corresponding section when clicked. 
- Then I added a screenshot of my first project, the Run Buddy project, to the My Work section, and made sure that when it was clicked it took the user to a separate link that contained the full Run Buddy project. 
- Once I had the full HTML layout, then I began styling each section. I started with the header and the nagivation, and then worked my way down. This was when I started picking out the colors I wanted to use, the fonts, and the layout of how I wanted the porfolio to look!
- Lastly, once all of the CSS was styled the way I wanted it, I began the media queries process by making sure that the site was responsive to all devices.
